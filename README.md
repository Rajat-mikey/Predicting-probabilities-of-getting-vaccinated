First read csv datasets and print head() to have a overlook of the file
Now check dtypes of each column of the dataset
Now to perform our task we have to join features_df and labels_df
further import all models like LogisticReression, MultiOutputClassifier,Pipeline,train_test_split etc.
Now we remove the columns whose dtypes are object as we have to be same dtype for performing MultiOutputClassifier
further steps are commented in Vaccine.pynb file
